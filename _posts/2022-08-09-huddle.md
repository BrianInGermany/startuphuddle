The startup huddle is your arena to test out new ideas or just bounce some thoughts off like-minded peers in your region. Learn where others are struggling and succeeding, and optimize your approaches, together.

It’s kinda last minute but we’re hoping to maintain the weekly tradition and get to know some cool new people over a whiteboard and a beer or two. Our startup club is changing and we’ll also have a few announcements so we’ll keep you all curious and hopefully see you tonight!

PS: Deutsch geht auch :)
