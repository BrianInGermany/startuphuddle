## Think Business
Why should employees benefit from _thinking business_, even if their salary isn't directly dependent on company profits?

Why should founders foster a spirit of entrepreneurial collaboration in their team members, even if the employees never had to do with it before?

At his new employer, [VUI.agency](https://vui.agency), Brian has enjoyed the freedom to learn and elaborate on how the company's value proposition is communicated. And it's led him to the conclusion that _everybody needs an elevator pitch_.

## Know your story
Whether a C-level at a sales event, or a developer at a house party, your team members need to know how to tell the story of what they do at your company, and how the company makes the world better. 

One fine day a great contact will cross your path with the potential for personal or company improvement: so be ready by knowing what story you'll tell. Think entrepreneurially.
